   <h1>REVIEW:</h1>
   <p>The above resource is collected by me. Hi , my name is Sajili Chakraborty and I am a final year undergrad pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Business Systems. Now,I am going to share the experience of my interview at IBS.</p>
   <p><i>I had my interview scheduled on 21st of August which was a Monday. I was not at all targetting this company but on the day of my interview the only thing that came to my mind was: I have to give my best and I will give my best, no matter what!
    at around 12pm, the pre-placement talk was over and at around 12.30 pm, the interview started. The clock was ticking and time was running out . With a blink of an eye it was 6.30 pm when our teacher told us that we can go back and come the following day for the interview. We could'nt decide and by the time we decided and came out of the classroom ,our placement guide asked us to go infront of the interview room and wait. At around 8.15pm , i went inside the room. 
    <br>
    The questions asked are listed below:
    <br>

    1.Introduce yourself.
    <br>
    2.What personal projects do you have?
    <br>
    3.Why don't you have any personal projects?
    <br>
    4.Have you thought of making one?
    <br>
    5.Which domain are you comfortable in?
    <br>
    6.Write this code.<br>
    7.What is cloud?<br>
    
    Thank you, I am done with you!<br>
    
    The reason behind telling so many things is that --- everybody does'nt own a personal project and the resume is provided to let the interviewer know which are the things I am familiar with. Worst cases are considerable like asking questions related to something which is out of my domain but how can someone judge a candidate based on what he/she has done earlier. I was even stopped from explaining my group project --- "I've already heard about this, don't have to elaborate" . I was definitely very unsatisfied with my interview and I am still. I am still unable kick out the whole thing off from my head. The review about this interview from the morning , was worse. Out of 20 maybe 1 or 2 was called for the HR round but  I still did'nt lose hope. Anyway, thanks to the interviewer who made me realise how important it is to have a project of your own . It was a bad experience overall, I agree. But ,this interview is a damn lesson for me for getting started with Web Dev and I started it too. 
    <br>
    Coming soon to crack the very next job and <b>I am too proud of my friends who got this job. So So happy for all of them!</b></i>
