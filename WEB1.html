        <h3>ABOUT SANTORINI:</h3>
        <p>Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced [sandoˈrini]), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα Greek pronunciation: [ˈθira]) and Classical Greek Thera (English pronunciation /ˈθɪərə/), is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km2 (34.990 sq mi).Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.</p>
        <h4>ECONOMY:</h4>
        <p>Santorini's primary industry is tourism, particularly in the summer months. Agriculture also forms part of its economy, and the island sustains a wine industry. The economic life of Santorini before 1960, when the flow of foreign visitors to the island for tourist purposes gradually began, was based on crops and trade.</p>
    
        <h5>FORTIFICATIONS:</h5>
        <p>Casteli (castles), also written as kasteli, were large fortified permanent settlements. There were five on the island, Agios Nikolaos (at Oia), Akrotiri, Emborio, Pyrgos, and Skaros. At the entrance to every casteli was a church dedicated to Agia (St.) Theodosia, the Protector-Saint of castles.
            Goulas (from the Turkish word kule which means 'tower'[61]) were multi-storey, rectangular, and the highest tower of most kastelli. There were four goulas on the island. They were used both as an observatory and as a place of refuge for the islanders. They had thick walls, parapets, an iron gate, murder holes, and embrasures.
            Viglio were small coastal watchtowers, which were permanently garrisoned, from where a watch was maintained and an alarm raised when a pirate ship was sighted.</p>

        <h6>PORTS:</h6>
        <p>Santorini has two ports: Athinios (Ferry Port) and Skala (Old Port).Cruise ships anchor off Skala and passengers are transferred by local boatmen to shore at Skala where Fira is accessed by cable car, on foot or by donkeys and mules. The use of donkeys for tourist transportation has attracted significant criticism from animal rights organisations for animal abuse and neglect, including failure to provide the donkeys with sufficient water or rest.  Tour boats depart from Skala for Nea Kameni and other Santorini destinations</p>

        <p>I am attaching the google meet link on which you will have your first orientation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So,the orientation will be based on the research work you will have to do about Santorini. Few things about this place has been already mentioned above for all of you so that you get a rough idea about the place Santorini and about the rest,use your brains and start it from today onwards.Rest of the things will be conveyed via the orientation.</p>
